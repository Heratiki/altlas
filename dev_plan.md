# AltLAS Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for improving the AltLAS reinforcement learning code generation system. The plan addresses several key issues identified during initial testing while maintaining the core philosophy of allowing the agent to develop its own approach to coding through emergent learning.

**IMPORTANT: Stability-First Development Principle**
All improvements and modifications in this plan should strictly adhere to this principle:
- New implementations must not break any existing working infrastructure
- Changes should be applied incrementally with thorough testing between steps
- Backward compatibility must be maintained for all critical components
- Refactoring should preserve behavior and interfaces of existing systems
- Each change should be isolated and reversible if unexpected issues arise

This conservative approach ensures that the evolution of AltLAS builds on our working foundation rather than risking destabilization of functioning components. All developers should verify that their changes integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase before merging.

## Current Issues

âœ“ FIXED
âœ“ IMPROVED
âœ“ FIXED
- **Training Signal Problems**: The model isn't learning effectively based on scores/rewards
  - Addressed through pattern-based task definitions, reward shaping, dynamic entropy, temperature-controlled sampling, and beam search
  - Further improvements needed for complex tasks âœ“ IMPROVED âœ“ ENHANCED
- **Code Structure Understanding**: Model lacks awareness of code hierarchies and syntax structures
  - Improved with Python grammar rules and template-guided generation âœ“ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
- **Task Complexity Scaling**: Current architecture may struggle with more complex programming tasks
- **Resource Management**: Need better control over computational resources per task

## Development Notes

*   **2025-04-07:** Completed initial implementation pass for priorities 1-6 and part of 7. Key changes include: reduced hinting frequency, explicit weight initialization & validation, improved REINFORCE (baseline, entropy, clipping), expanded vocabulary, improved tokenizer (greedy matching), enhanced fingerprinting (case-sensitive), extensive logging additions, benchmark task creation, and CLI task selection.
*   **Observation:** Running `benchmark_add_two_numbers` showed successful initialization and functioning training loop. Code quality improved from nonsensical strings but still requires significant training to solve the task. Hinting is now much less frequent.
*   **Next Steps:** Focus on longer training runs, analyzing logs (Task 7.2), refining tokenizer (INDENT/DEDENT), and potentially adding more complex duplicate handling (Task 5.2). Implemented graceful Ctrl+C handling in runner.py. Centralized logging with RichHandler to fix UI disruption.
*   **2025-04-08:** Implemented reward shaping in `scorer.py` based on syntax validity (0.15 for valid syntax, 0.05 for invalid) to provide a better learning gradient. Corrected REINFORCE policy loss calculation in `generator.py`. Added dynamic entropy coefficient that decreases as success rate increases. Implemented task-specific max_tokens to better handle varying task complexities.
*   **2025-04-08 (2):** Implemented pattern-based task definitions to better handle multiple valid solution approaches. Updated scorer.py to recognize different solution patterns and implemented constraint checking. This change makes tasks self-contained and more flexible for future complexity scaling.
*   **2025-04-08 (3):** Implemented significant improvements to help the model break through the 0.50 score threshold: Added temperature-controlled sampling, Python grammar rules, template-guided generation, weight reset mechanism for bad local minima, and beam search generation. Initial testing shows these changes allow the model to generate syntactically valid Python code and solve the add_two_numbers benchmark more consistently.
*   **2025-04-08 (4):** Completely refactored the `AttemptScorer` class with an adaptive, task-agnostic reward shaping system. The new implementation features multiple specialized evaluation components (syntax, execution, output matching, structural patterns, constraints, and semantic similarity) with dynamic weighting. This creates a smoother learning gradient that scales with task complexity while avoiding hardcoded benchmark-specific logic. Early testing shows improved rewards for partial solutions and better differentiation between various code quality levels.
*   **2025-04-08 (5):** Created a comprehensive training report template (`training_report.md`) that captures key metrics from training cycles. The template includes sections for run metadata, performance metrics, pattern analysis, learning status indicators, resource utilization, and historical comparisons. This will provide better visibility into the learning process and facilitate more informed adjustments to the system. Next steps involve implementing the report generator and integrating it with the training loop.
*   **2025-04-08 (6):** Implemented the core `TrainingReportGenerator` and integrated it with `runner.py`. Reports are now generated periodically based on `config.ini`. Added basic token distribution analysis and keyword-based pattern counting to the report. Fixed several bugs related to template path resolution and import errors. Implemented report rotation to keep the latest 5 reports.
*   **2025-04-08 (7):** Completed remaining core features for Task 13: Added option (`ReportOnSuccess`) to generate a final report on task success, implemented basic semantic drift detection based on output similarity, and added automatic generation of simple insights (plateau detection, syntax error frequency) and recommendations to the report.
*   **2025-04-09:** Implemented several strategies to address training stagnation around 4500 iterations: 
    - Added a penalty mechanism in `TrainingLoop._perform_learning_step` for repeatedly generating failed code patterns (Task 5.2).
    - Enhanced `TrainingLoop._generate_code_attempt` with a weight reset trigger based on prolonged beam search stagnation (Task 12.4).
    - Introduced a beam search cooling-off period after weight resets (Task 12.5).
    - Added logic to occasionally skip beam search if token distribution becomes highly skewed (Task 12.5).
    - Increased `HintProbabilityOnStuck` to 0.5 and slightly increased entropy coefficients in `config.ini` to encourage more exploration.
    - Fixed indentation error in `AttemptManager.log_attempt`.
*   **2025-04-09 (2):** Completed Task 5.2 by implementing memory of failed approaches (using `failed_fingerprints` in `AttemptManager`) and adding an exploration boost (increased temperature) in `TrainingLoop._generate_code_attempt` when recent attempts consist mostly of known failed patterns.
*   **2025-04-09 (3):** Implemented exponential backoff for hint frequency in `TrainingLoop._update_stuck_status` (Task 1.2). The hint probability now decreases by half each time a hint is skipped due to the probability check, making hints progressively rarer if they are not leading to improvements.
